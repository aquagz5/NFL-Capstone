    "Remember, the purpose of this model is to predict when a tackle occurs. The data that was given to us filtered data out based on non-ball carrier plays, such as pass incomplete and quarterback sacks. The focus of this data was to predict when a tackle was going to occur given their was a ball carrier on the play. For example, the quarterback is snapped the ball, but he is not deemed as the ball carrier right away because he will either pass the ball or hand it off. Once the quarterback has passed the ball, and the ball has been posssessed by a reciever, the reciever is now considered a ball carrier. Likewise, if the running back is handed the ball, they are not considered the ball carrier until they have recieved the ball. In the data, we could identify, that a quarterback has been deemed a runner rather than a passer when the event tag of \"run\" occurs on a given play. \n",

Then we only want to consider frames when the tackle has occured or an appropriate event tag the signifies the end of a play. We can disregard all other frames after the play was completed. Thus, the purpose of this function is to take the tracking data and remove unneccessary frames at the end of the play and frames at the beginning of the play with no definitive ball carrier.\n",
